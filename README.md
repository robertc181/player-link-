# Summary

Player Link is an online platform that will link football players with scouts, So that scouts can watch a football player and find out when they will be playing there next football games and more information about that player, such as current team , position , preffered foot etc. A player will be able to create an account with Player Link and put up information about themselves, they can also create an event which they can set a time place and name. If a scout searches for a player on Player Link they will be allowed to view a players events and click on the ones that they wish to watch. 

A scout can also sign up with Player Link to find talented footballers and get more information about them and there football games. They will have a profile where they can search for players and view all players profiles and see thier events 

# UX

## App Goals

My objective with Player Link is to firstly allow scouts who are struggling to find players around thier area to scout and help them connect with players and hopefully come accross some talent, Player Link allows a scout to search for a players name then click to view that players profile. A scout can click to attend an event such as a game or tournament which will notify the player that the scout is going to thier event. As a player this allows many player with a chance to connect with more scouts and hopefully get a better chance to showcase thier talent and invite more scouts to thier games.

# Plan

## initial plan

- [Flow Chart](https://github.com/robertc181/player-link-/blob/master/Plan/IMG_0679.jpg)
- [Routing plan](https://github.com/robertc181/player-link-/blob/master/Plan/IMG_0691.jpg)
- [Data Structure](https://github.com/robertc181/player-link-/blob/master/Plan/data-structure)

## Changes to plan

1. Instead of creating to diferent profile types for a scout and a player I am now using a generic users database to store a users data where a user has a user_type which will be a player or a scout

2. I have changed the data structure to have a users collection and a profiles collection. A user can register and then fill out a profile form to create their profile
